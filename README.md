# Introduction

In this notebook, you will create a medical chatbot based on the model **[aaditya/Llama3-OpenBioLLM-8B](https://huggingface.co/aaditya/Llama3-OpenBioLLM-8B)** and also perform LoRA fine-tuning with the dataset `intern_screening_dataset.csv`.

<br>

You can access the notebook on Google Colab through the following link: **[Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FvwteGpzqEUmcHqN_WqmMC1PPpwmYZ-E?usp=sharing)**


<br>

## Problem Statement

Develop a medical question-answering system utilizing the provided dataset containing medical information. The goal is to create a model that can effectively answer user queries related to medical diseases. You are free to augment the provided dataset with other medical datasets if you feel it is necessary.

<br>

### Constraints

The chatbot must be developed within a 2-day deadline, but future improvements are suggested at the end.

<br>

### Approaches Evaluated

- My initial idea was to use a transformer model with fewer parameters, such as **BERT** or **T5**, but I was concerned about the potential risk of hallucinations in the completions.
- I also considered running a **RAG** on a more powerful model like **GPT** and kept this alternative as a viable option.
- I ultimately decided to go with fine-tuning a **LLM** model to ensure more reliable, domain-specific answers by leveraging a pretrained model with large medical datasets.
- The deadline was an issue, as full fine-tuning could take days. To optimize time, I chose to use **PEFT LoRA**.

<br>

### Notebook Instance

Fine-tuning was performed using an **A100 instance on Google Colab**.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

This is an example of an entry in the dataset **intern_screening_dataset.csv**, which contains the columns **question** and **answer**:

<br>

**Question:**
> *What are the symptoms of Diabetes?*

**Answer:**
> Diabetes is often called a "silent" disease because it can cause serious complications even before you have symptoms. Symptoms can also be so mild that you don't notice them. An estimated 8 million people in the United States have type 2 diabetes and don't know it, according to 2012 estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) *(continuesâ€¦)*.

<br>

I assessed the data integrity by checking for missing columns in the dataset with the script `exploratory_data_analysis.py`:



```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('./data/raw/intern_screening_dataset.csv')

print(f"Total number of entries: {df.shape[0]}")

print(f"Empty questions: {df['question'].isnull().sum()}")
print(f"Empty answers: {df['answer'].isnull().sum()}")

df['question_answer'] = df['question'] + '|' + df['answer']
duplicate_count = df['question_answer'].duplicated().sum()
print(f"Duplicated question-answer pairs: {duplicate_count}")

```

    Total number of entries: 16406
    Empty questions: 0
    Empty answers: 5
    Duplicated question-answer pairs: 52


Before starting the Data Preprocessing, I decided to first perform the Model Selection in order to use the tokenizer tailored for this model and to prepare the columns expected for fine-tuning.

<br>

I researched similar applications and found many Open Source models on Hugging Face:

- [Medical LLM Leaderboard - Fenglin Liu](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fenglinliu/medical_llm_leaderboard)
- [Medical-Llama3-v2 - Ruslanmv](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ruslanmv/Medical-Llama3-v2)
- [Open Medical LLM Leaderboard - Open Life Science AI](https://huggingface.co/spaces/openlifescienceai/open_medical_llm_leaderboard)
- [MedLLMs Practical Guide - AI in Health](https://github.com/AI-in-Health/MedLLMsPracticalGuide?tab=readme-ov-file)
- [Open Medical LLM Leaderboard - Open Life Science AI](https://huggingface.co/spaces/openlifescienceai/open_medical_llm_leaderboard)
- [Hugging Face Blog - Medical LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/blog/leaderboard-medicalllm)

<br>

I would have liked to evaluate the models more thoroughly, but due to time constraints, I decided to choose the aaditya/Llama3-OpenBioLLM-70B model, which stood out for surpassing GPT and Gemini models in benchmarks:

<br>

![Medical Benchmark Datasets](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/5f3fe13d79c1ba4c353d0c19/oPchsJsEpQoGcGXVbh7YS.png)

Due to being a 70B model, fine-tuning became computationally infeasible, but OpenBioLLM has a smaller 8B variant that fits within the GPU capacity of a Google Colab A100 instance.

<br>

Since OpenBioLLM was trained on a vast corpus of high-quality biomedical data, it meets the task requirement that states "You are free to augment the provided dataset with other medical datasets if you feel it is necessary."

<br>

The model fetch may take up to 10 minutes, so I created the fetch_model.py script to save the model and tokenizer in a local directory:



```python
import transformers
import torch

# Fetch model from Hugging Face
model_id = "aaditya/OpenBioLLM-Llama3-8B"
model = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)

# Save model and tokenizer locally
save_directory = "./models"
model.save_pretrained(save_directory)
tokenizer.save_pretrained(save_directory)

print(f"Model and Tokenizer saved in: {save_directory}")

```

    Model and Tokenizer saved in: ./models


<br>

The script `test_reference_model.py` allows testing the Question Answering task of the **OpenBioLLM-Llama3-8B** model.
The script follows the snippet on the OpenBioLLM-8B page: https://huggingface.co/aaditya/Llama3-OpenBioLLM-8B



```python
import transformers
import torch

model_id = "aaditya/OpenBioLLM-Llama3-8B"

pipeline = transformers.pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model_id,
    model_kwargs={"torch_dtype": torch.bfloat16},
    device="cuda",
)

# Prompt context and question
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert and experienced from the healthcare and biomedical domain with extensive medical knowledge and practical experience. Your name is OpenBioLLM, and you were developed by Saama AI Labs. who's willing to help answer the user's query with explanation. In your explanation, leverage your deep medical expertise such as relevant anatomical structures, physiological processes, diagnostic criteria, treatment guidelines, or other pertinent medical concepts. Use precise medical terminology while still aiming to make the explanation clear and accessible to a general audience."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What are the symptoms of Diabetes?"}
]

# Prompt building
prompt = ""
for message in messages:
    prompt += f"{message['role'].capitalize()}: {message['content']}\n"

outputs = pipeline(
    prompt,
    max_new_tokens=512,
    do_sample=True,
    temperature=0.1,
    top_p=0.9,
    eos_token_id=pipeline.tokenizer.eos_token_id,
)

print(outputs[0]["generated_text"][len(prompt):])

```

    OpenBioLLM: Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the body's ability to regulate blood sugar levels. Common symptoms of diabetes include frequent urination, excessive thirst, unexplained weight loss, increased hunger, fatigue, blurred vision, slow-healing sores or frequent infections, and tingling or numbness in the hands or feet. These symptoms may vary from person to person and can also be associated with other medical conditions. It is important to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of diabetes.


## Data Preprocessing

The `data_preprocessing.py` script performs the following techniques:

- Removed entries with missing answers.
- Removed duplicate question-answer pairs.
- Dropped answers shorter than 100 characters.
- Normalized text (lowercase and stripped spaces).
- Removed special characters.
- Tokenized questions and answers using Hugging Face AutoTokenizer, creating `input_ids` and labels.
- Truncated and padded sequences to a maximum length of 512.
- Computed start and end token positions for answers using `char_to_token`.
- Converted the cleaned DataFrame to a Hugging Face Dataset and saved it.

I encountered some difficulty aligning the columns correctly when preparing the dataset for fine-tuning, particularly ensuring that the columns `input_ids`, `labels`, `start_positions`, and `end_positions` were properly formatted.

<br>

To develop the `get_answer_positions` function, I consulted the following resources:

- [Hugging Face Custom Datasets Guide](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v3.1.0/custom_datasets.html)
- [Hugging Face Documentation on Question Answering](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/question_answering)
- [WandB Article on Extractive Question Answering with Hugging Face](https://wandb.ai/mostafaibrahim17/ml-articles/reports/Extractive-Question-Answering-With-HuggingFace-Using-PyTorch-and-W-B--Vmlldzo0MzMwOTY5)

<br>



```python
import pandas as pd
import re
from datasets import Dataset
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

# Special characters cleaning
def clean_text(text):
    text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', text)  # Punctuation
    text = re.sub(r'\d+', '', text)  # Numbers
    return text

# Get start and end positions of the answer
def get_answer_positions(question, answer):
    context = question + " " + answer
    start = context.find(answer)
    end = start + len(answer) - 1

    # Tokenize the context
    tokenized_context = tokenizer(context, truncation=True, padding='max_length', max_length=512)

    start_token_pos = tokenized_context.char_to_token(start)
    end_token_pos = tokenized_context.char_to_token(end)

    # Get last valid token in case of None
    if start_token_pos is None or end_token_pos is None:
        start_token_pos = len(tokenized_context['input_ids']) - 1
        end_token_pos = len(tokenized_context['input_ids']) - 1

    return start_token_pos, end_token_pos


df = pd.read_csv('./data/raw/intern_screening_dataset.csv')

# Removed entries with missing answers
df = df.dropna(subset=['answer'])

# Removed duplicate question-answer pairs
df['question_answer'] = df['question'] + ' | ' + df['answer']
df = df.drop_duplicates(subset='question_answer')
df.drop(columns='question_answer', inplace=True)

# Dropped answers shorter than 100 characters
df = df[df['answer'].str.strip().str.len() > 100]

# Normalized text (lowercase and stripped spaces)
df['question'] = df['question'].str.lower()
df['answer'] = df['answer'].str.lower()

df['question'] = df['question'].str.strip()
df['answer'] = df['answer'].str.strip()

# Removed special characters
df['question'] = df['question'].apply(clean_text)
df['answer'] = df['answer'].apply(clean_text)

# Tokenized questions and answers using Hugging Face AutoTokenizer, creating input_ids and labels
model_id = "aaditya/OpenBioLLM-Llama3-8B"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)

df['input_ids'] = df['question'].apply(lambda x: tokenizer.encode(x, padding='max_length', truncation=True, max_length=512))
df['labels'] = df['answer'].apply(lambda x: tokenizer.encode(x, padding='max_length', truncation=True, max_length=512))

# Computed start and end token positions for answers using char_to_token
df['start_positions'], df['end_positions'] = zip(*df.apply(lambda x: get_answer_positions(x['question'], x['answer']), axis=1))

# Drop as colunas question e answer
df.drop(columns=['question', 'answer'], inplace=True)

# Keeping only necessary columns
df = df.reset_index(drop=True)
df = df[['input_ids', 'labels', 'start_positions', 'end_positions']]

print(df.head(5))

# Converted the cleaned DataFrame to a Hugging Face Dataset and saved it
dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(df)
dataset.save_to_disk('./data/processed/intern_screening_dataset')

## Model Training

The `fine_tuning.py` script performs PEFT LoRA fine-tuning for the Question Answering task. The training took approximately 2 hours and was conducted with standard hyperparameters:

<br>

I used the following resources as references to develop the fine-tuning LoRA function for the Llama 3-8B model:

The fine-tuning is converging, as both the Training Loss and Validation Loss are decreasing with each epoch.  

<br>

It would be beneficial to run for more epochs and perform hyperparameter tuning. However, due to time constraints, I will proceed to the model evaluation stage.


## Model Evaluation

Since the reference model aaditya/Llama3-OpenBioLLM-8B was trained for the LlamaForCausalLM architecture, the most appropriate evaluation metric is ROUGE.

<br>

ROUGE is commonly used for evaluating text generation tasks, where the focus is on comparing the generated text with reference text based on recall, precision, and F1 score.

<br>

The script `model_evaluation.py` calculates the ROUGE for the **aaditya/Llama3-OpenBioLLM-8B** model with and without fine-tuning using the `intern_screening_dataset.csv` dataset:




```python
import transformers
import torch

    Question: What is (are) Glaucoma ?
    Answer from Dataset: The optic nerve is a bundle of more than 1 million nerve fibers. It connects the retina to the brain.
    Answer from Fine-tuned Model: Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, usually due to increased intraocular pressure. It can lead to vision loss if left untreated. There are two main types of glaucoma: primary open-angle glaucoma and angle-closure glaucoma. Primary open-angle glaucoma is more common and occurs when the drainage angle formed by the cornea and iris becomes clogged over time. Angle-closure glaucoma happens when the fluid in the front part of the eye cannot circulate properly because the drainage angle is blocked.
    Answer from Reference Model: Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that lead to optic nerve damage and can result in vision loss. It is often associated with increased intraocular pressure, which damages the optic nerve over time. There are two main types of glaucoma: primary open-angle glaucoma, which is the most common type, and angle-closure glaucoma. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent further vision loss.
    --------------------------------------------------
    Question: How to prevent High Blood Pressure ?
    Answer from Dataset: Steps You Can Take You can take steps to prevent high blood pressure by adopting these healthy lifestyle habits. - Follow a healthy eating plan.   - Be physically active.   - Maintain a healthy weight.  - If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation.   - Quit smoking.  - Learn to cope with and manage stress. Follow a healthy eating plan. Be physically active. Maintain a healthy weight. If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation. Quit smoking. Learn to cope with and manage stress. Follow a Healthy Eating Plan Follow a healthy eating plan that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products, and whole grains, and that is low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and total fat. Eating this way is even more effective when you also reduce your sodium (salt) intake and calories. One such eating plan is called DASH. DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. This is the name of a study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health that showed that this kind of eating plan can help you prevent and control high blood pressure. The study also showed that combining this kind of eating plan with cutting back on salt in your diet is even more effective at lowering your blood pressure. To learn more about DASH, see  Lowering Your Blood Pressure with DASH. Lower Your Salt Intake In general, the lower your salt intake, the lower your blood pressure. Older adults should limit their sodium intake to 2,300 milligrams (mg) daily. The key to reducing the amount of salt we eat is making wise food choices. Only a small amount of the salt that we eat comes from the salt shaker, and only small amounts occur naturally in food. Most of the salt that we eat comes from processed foods -- for example, canned or processed meat, baked goods, certain cereals, soy sauce, and foods that contain seasoned salts, monosodium glutamate (MSG), and baking soda. Food from fast food restaurants, frozen foods, and canned foods also tend to be higher in sodium. See tips to reduce salt in your diet. Read Food Labels Be sure to read food labels to choose products lower in salt. Look for foods and seasonings that are labeled as low-salt or "no added salt." Look for the sodium content in milligrams and the Percent Daily Value. Aim for foods that are less than 5 percent of the Daily Value of sodium. Foods with 20 percent or more Daily Value of sodium are considered high. To learn more about reading nutrition labels, see  Reading the Label. Be Physically Active  Regular physical activity can lower high blood pressure and reduce your risk for other health problems. Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 hours and 30 minutes per week, or vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats harder and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10 minutes at a time, spread throughout the week. (Watch the video to learn how exercise maintains healthy aging.

Most people dont need to see a doctor before they start a moderate-level physical activity. You should check first with your doctor if you - have heart trouble or have had a heart attack   - are over age 50 and are not used to moderate-level physical activity  - have a family history of heart disease at an early age, or if you have any other serious health problem. have heart trouble or have had a heart attack are over age 50 and are not used to moderate-level physical activity have a family history of heart disease at an early age, or if you have any other serious health problem. See examples of exercises for older adults at Exercises to Try. For more on exercise and physical activity for older adults, visit Go4Life, the exercise and physical activity campaign from the National Institute on Aging. Maintain a Healthy Weight Maintaining a healthy weight can help you control high blood pressure and reduce your risk for other health problems. Blood pressure rises as body weight increases. Losing even 10 pounds can lower blood pressure -- and it has the greatest effect for those who are overweight and already have hypertension. A useful measure of overweight and obesity is body mass index (BMI). BMI measures your weight in relation to your height.  See the BMI calculator to determine your body mass index  or talk to your health care provider. A BMI -  below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.   - between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the healthy range.  - between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.  - of 30 or more is considered obese. below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight. between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the healthy range. between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight. of 30 or more is considered obese. A general goal to aim for is a BMI below 25. Your health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal. Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit  Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk. For more information about losing weight or maintaining your weight, see Aim for a Healthy Weight.  If You Drink  Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Men should have no more than two drinks a day, and women should have no more than one drink a day. If you drink and would like tips on how to cut back, watch the video "How To Cut Back on Your Drinking." (To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) See how drinking alcohol can affect you as you age. Don't Smoke Smoking injures blood vessel walls and speeds up the process of hardening of the arteries. It increases your chances of stroke, heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and several forms of cancer. If you smoke, quit. If you don't smoke, don't start. Once you quit, your risk of having a heart attack is reduced after the first year. So you have a lot to gain by quitting. See how to start a smoking quit plan geared to older adults.
    Answer from Fine-tuned Model: To prevent high blood pressure, it is important to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Here are some recommendations:  1.

    Question: What are the treatments for Osteoarthritis ?
    Answer from Dataset: Treatment Goals: Manage Pain, Improve Function Osteoarthritis treatment plans often include ways to manage pain and improve function. Such plans can include exercise, rest and joint care, pain relief, weight control, medicines, surgery, and non-traditional treatment approaches. Current treatments for osteoarthritis can relieve symptoms such as pain and disability, but right now there are no treatments that can cure osteoarthritis. Exercise: One of the Best Treatments Exercise is one of the best treatments for osteoarthritis. It can improve mood and outlook, decrease pain, increase flexibility, and help you maintain a healthy weight. The amount and form of exercise will depend on which joints are involved, how stable the joints are, whether or not the joint is swollen, and whether a joint replacement has already been done. Ask your doctor or physical therapist what exercises are best for you The following types of exercise are part of a well-rounded arthritis treatment plan. -  Strengthening exercises.  These exercises strengthen muscles that support joints affected by arthritis. They can be performed with weights or with exercise bands, inexpensive devices that add resistance.  - Aerobic activities.  These are exercises, such as brisk walking or low-impact aerobics, that get your heart pumping and can keep your lungs and circulatory system in shape.   -  Range-of-motion activities.  These keep your joints limber.  - Balance and agility exercises.  These help you maintain your balance and reduce the risk of falling.   Strengthening exercises.

To see examples of exercises for older adults, see  Exercises to Try or visit Go4Life,  the National Institute on Agings exercise and physical activity program for older adults. Weight Control If you are overweight or obese, you should try to lose weight. Weight loss can reduce stress on weight-bearing joints, limit further injury, increase mobility, and reduce the risk of associated health problems. A dietitian can help you develop healthy eating habits. A healthy diet and regular exercise help reduce weight. Rest and Relief from Stress on Joints Treatment plans include regularly scheduled rest. You must learn to recognize the bodys signals, and know when to stop or slow down. This will prevent the pain caused by overexertion. Although pain can make it difficult to sleep, getting proper sleep is important for managing arthritis pain. If you have trouble sleeping, you may find that relaxation techniques, stress reduction, and biofeedback can help. Timing medications to provide maximum pain relief through the night can also help. If joint pain interferes with your ability to sleep or rest, consult your doctor. Some people find relief from special footwear and insoles that can reduce pain and improve walking or from using canes to take pressure off painful joints. They may use splints or braces to provide extra support for joints and/ or keep them in proper position during sleep or activity. Splints should be used only for limited periods of time because joints and muscles need to be exercised to prevent stiffness and weakness. If you need a splint, an occupational therapist or a doctor can help you get a properly fitted one. Non-drug Pain Relief and Alternative Therapies People with osteoarthritis may find many nondrug ways to relieve pain. Below are some examples. - Heat and cold. Heat or cold (or a combination of the two) can be useful for joint pain. Heat can be applied in a number of different ways -- with warm towels, hot packs, or a warm bath or shower -- to increase blood flow and ease pain and stiffness. In some cases, cold packs (bags of ice or frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel), which reduce inflammation, can relieve pain or numb the sore area. (Check with a doctor or physical therapist to find out if heat or cold is the best treatment.) Heat and cold. Heat or cold (or a combination of the two) can be useful for joint pain.

(Check with a doctor or physical therapist to find out if heat or cold is the best treatment.) - Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). TENS is a technique that uses a small electronic device to direct mild electric pulses to nerve endings that lie beneath the skin in the painful area. TENS may relieve some arthritis pain. It seems to work by blocking pain messages to the brain and by modifying pain perception. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).

It seems to work by blocking pain messages to the brain and by modifying pain perception. - Massage.  In this pain-relief approach, a massage therapist will lightly stroke and/or knead the painful muscles. This may increase blood flow and bring warmth to a stressed area. However, arthritis-stressed joints are sensitive, so the therapist must be familiar with the problems of the disease.  Massage.

However, arthritis-stressed joints are sensitive, so the therapist must be familiar with the problems of the disease. -  Acupuncture.  Some people have found pain relief using acupuncture, a practice in which fine needles are inserted by a licensed acupuncture therapist at specific points on the skin. Scientists think the needles stimulate the release of natural, pain-relieving chemicals produced by the nervous system. A large study supported by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) revealed that acupuncture relieves pain and improves function in knee osteoarthritis, and it serves as an effective complement to standard care.

Additional studies have been carried out to further evaluate these claims. It is unknown whether they might change the course of disease. - Folk remedies. These include the wearing of copper bracelets, following special diets, and rubbing WD-40 on joints to lubricate them. Although these practices may or may not be harmful, no scientific research to date shows that they are helpful in treating osteoarthritis. They can also be expensive, and using them may cause people to delay or even abandon useful medical treatment. Folk remedies.

Although these practices may or may not be harmful, no scientific research to date shows that they are helpful in treating osteoarthritis. They can also be expensive, and using them may cause people to delay or even abandon useful medical treatment. For general information on alternative therapies, see the Complementary Health Approaches topic. Medications Doctors consider a number of factors when choosing medicines for their patients. In particular, they look at the type of pain the patient may be having and any possible side effects from the drugs. For pain relief, doctors usually start with acetaminophen because the side effects are minimal. If acetaminophen does not relieve pain, then non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen may be used. Some NSAIDs are available over the counter, while more than a dozen others, including a subclass called COX-2 inhibitors, are available only with a prescription. Other medications, including corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid, and topical creams are also used. Reduce the Risks of NSAID Use Most medicines used to treat osteoarthritis have side effects, so it is important for people to learn about the medicines they take. For example, people over age 65 and those with any history of ulcers or stomach bleeding should use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, with caution. There are measures you can take to help reduce the risk of side effects associated with NSAIDs. These include taking medications with food and avoiding stomach irritants such as alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine. In some cases, it may help to take another medication along with an NSAID to coat the stomach or block stomach acids. Although these measures may help, they are not always completely effective. For more tips on how older adults can avoid side effects, see Side Effects  in the Taking Medicines topic. Surgery For many people, surgery helps relieve the pain and disability of osteoarthritis. Surgery may be performed to achieve one or more of the following goals. - Removal of loose pieces of bone and cartilage from the joint if they are causing symptoms of buckling or locking (arthroscopic debridement).  - Repositioning of bones (osteotomy).  - Resurfacing (smoothing out) bones (joint resurfacing). Removal of loose pieces of bone and cartilage from the joint if they are causing symptoms of buckling or locking (arthroscopic debridement). Repositioning of bones (osteotomy). Resurfacing (smoothing out) bones (joint resurfacing). Joint Replacement Surgeons may replace affected joints with artificial joints called prostheses. These joints can be made from metal alloys, high-density plastic, and ceramic material. Some prostheses are joined to bone surfaces with special cements. Others have porous surfaces and rely on the growth of bone into that surface (a process called biologic fixation) to hold them in place. Artificial joints can last 10 to 15 years or longer. Surgeons choose the design and components of prostheses according to their patients weight, sex, age, activity level, and other medical conditions. Joint replacement advances in recent years have included the ability, in some cases, to replace only the damaged part of the knee joint, leaving undamaged parts of the joint intact, and the ability to perform hip replacement through much smaller incisions than previously possible. For more on joint replacement see the Hip Replacement and Knee Replacement topics. Deciding on Surgery The decision to use surgery depends on several factors, including the patients age, occupation, level of disability, pain intensity, and the degree to which arthritis interferes with his or her lifestyle. After surgery and rehabilitation, the patient usually feels less pain and swelling and can move more easily.
    Answer from Fine-tuned Model: There are several treatment options available for managing Osteoarthritis. These include:  1. Medications: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help reduce pain and inflammation. Acetaminophen may also be used for pain relief. 2. Physical therapy: Exercises and physical therapy can improve joint function and reduce pain. 3. Weight management: Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce stress on the joints and alleviate symptoms. 4. Assistive devices: Using assistive devices like braces, canes, or walkers can provide support and relieve pressure on the affected joints. 5. Injections: Corticosteroid injections or hyaluronic acid injections can provide temporary pain relief and reduce inflammation. 6. Surgery: In severe cases, surgical interventions such as joint replacement surgery may be recommended.  It is important to note that the choice of treatment depends on the individual's specific condition and should be determined in consultation with a healthcare professional.
    Answer from Reference Model: There are several treatment options for Osteoarthritis. Non-pharmacological interventions include weight management, physical therapy, and exercise.

    Answer from Dataset: Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people - age 65 and older - under age 65 with certain disabilities who have been receiving Social Security disability benefits for a certain amount of time (24 months in most cases) - of any age who have End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), which is permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant. age 65 and older under age 65 with certain disabilities who have been receiving Social Security disability benefits for a certain amount of time (24 months in most cases) of any age who have End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), which is permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant. Medicare helps with the cost of health care, but it does not cover all medical expenses.
    Answer from Fine-tuned Model: Medicare and Continuing Care are terms used in the healthcare system to describe different aspects of patient care and coverage.  Medicare refers to a federal health insurance program in the United States that provides coverage for certain medical services for people who are 65 years of age or older, or who have specific disabilities and meet other eligibility criteria. It helps to cover hospital stays, doctor visits, prescription drugs, and other healthcare costs.  Continuing Care, on the other hand, refers to a comprehensive approach to providing long-term healthcare services to individuals with chronic illnesses, disabilities, or other ongoing health conditions. It involves a coordinated and continuous care plan that may span multiple healthcare settings, including hospitals, clinics, rehabilitation facilities, and even at home.  The main goal of continuing care is to promote optimal health outcomes, improve quality of life, and provide support to patients and their families over an extended period of time. It often involves a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, therapists, social workers, and others, working together to develop and implement an individualized care plan tailored to the specific needs of the patient.  It's important to note that the specific details and implementation of Medicare and Continuing Care can vary depending on the country or region, as well as individual circumstances. It's always advisable to consult with healthcare professionals or relevant authorities for more detailed information and guidance.

    Question: What are the symptoms of Kidney Disease ?
    Answer from Dataset: Kidney Disease Kidney disease is often called a "silent" disease, because most people have no symptoms with early kidney disease. In fact, you might feel just fine until your kidneys have almost stopped working. Do NOT wait for symptoms! If you are at risk for kidney disease, talk to your health care provider about getting tested. (Watch the video to learn more about the symptoms of kidney disease. To enlarge the videos on this page, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner of the video screen. To reduce the videos, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) Symptoms of Kidney Failure Kidney failure means that damaged kidneys are filtering less than 15% of the amount of blood filtered by healthy kidneys. If kidney disease progresses to kidney failure, a number of symptoms may occur. Some people experience fatigue, some lose their appetite, and some have leg cramps. These problems are caused by waste products that build up in the blood, a condition known as uremia. Healthy kidneys remove waste products from the blood. When the kidneys stop working, uremia occurs. The kidneys also make hormones and balance the minerals in the blood. When the kidneys stop working, most people develop conditions that affect the blood, bones, nerves, and skin. These problems may include itching, sleep problems, restless legs, weak bones, joint problems, and depression. How Kidney Disease Is Diagnosed  Blood and urine tests are the only way to check for kidney damage or measure kidney function. It is important for you to get checked for kidney disease if you have the key risk factors, which are - diabetes  - high blood pressure   - heart disease  - a family history of kidney failure.  diabetes high blood pressure heart disease a family history of kidney failure. If you are at risk, ask about your kidneys at your next medical appointment. The sooner you know you have kidney disease, the sooner you can get treatment to help delay or prevent kidney failure. If you have diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or a family history of kidney failure, you should get a blood and urine test to check your kidneys. Talk to your provider about how often you should be tested. (Watch the video to learn more about tests for kidney disease.) Blood Test The blood test checks your GFR. GFR stands for glomerular (glow-MAIR-you-lure) filtration rate. GFR is a measure of how much blood your kidneys filter each minute. This shows how well your kidneys are working. GFR is reported as a number. -  A GFR of 60 or higher is in the normal range.   - A GFR below 60 may mean you have kidney disease. However, because GFR decreases as people age, other information may be needed to determine if you actually have kidney disease.  - A GFR of 15 or lower may mean kidney failure.  A GFR of 60 or higher is in the normal range. A GFR below 60 may mean you have kidney disease. However, because GFR decreases as people age, other information may be needed to determine if you actually have kidney disease. A GFR of 15 or lower may mean kidney failure. You can't raise your GFR, but you can try to keep it from going lower. Ask your healthcare provider what you can do to keep your kidneys healthy.  Learn more about the GFR test. Urine Test The urine test looks for albumin (al-BYOO-min), a type of protein, in your urine. A healthy kidney does not let albumin pass into the urine. A damaged kidney lets some albumin pass into the urine. This test has several different names. You could be told that you are being screened for "proteinuria" or "albuminuria" or "microalbuminuria." Or you could be told that your "urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio" (UACR) is being measured. If you have albumin or protein in your urine, it could mean you have kidney disease. -  A urine albumin result below 30 is normal.  - A urine albumin result above 30 is not normal and may mean kidney disease. A urine albumin result below 30 is normal. A urine albumin result above 30 is not normal and may mean kidney disease. Learn more about the urine albumin test. Your healthcare provider might do additional tests to be sure.
    Answer from Fine-tuned Model: Kidney disease can present with a variety of symptoms, which may vary depending on the stage and cause of the disease. Common symptoms include:  1. Fatigue and weakness: The kidneys play a role in producing erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production. In kidney disease, there may be a decrease in erythropoietin levels, leading to anemia and subsequent fatigue and weakness.  2. Fluid retention and swelling: Damaged kidneys may struggle to remove excess fluid and sodium from the body, leading to fluid retention and swelling in the legs, ankles, feet, face, or hands.  3. Urination changes: Frequent urination, foamy or bubbly urine, blood in the urine (hematuria), or a decrease in urine output can all be signs of kidney disease.  4. High blood pressure: The kidneys help regulate blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. When the kidneys are damaged, they may not effectively remove excess fluid and sodium, leading to high blood pressure.  5. Loss of appetite and unintended weight loss: As kidney function declines, waste products can build up in the body, causing a loss of appetite and unintended weight loss.  6. Nausea and vomiting: Accumulation of waste products and toxins in the body can lead to gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.  It is important to note that some individuals with kidney disease may not experience any symptoms until the disease has progressed to a more advanced stage. Regular check-ups and monitoring of kidney function are crucial for early detection and management of kidney disease.

    Question: What is (are) Alzheimer's Disease ?
    Answer from Dataset: Alzheimers disease is a brain disease that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks. It begins slowly and gets worse over time. Currently, it has no cure. Alzheimers disease is the most common cause of dementia in older people.  Get more details about Alzheimer's disease.
    Answer from Fine-tuned Model: Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the brain, leading to cognitive decline and memory loss. It is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of cases. The exact cause of Alzheimer's is still unknown, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. The disease typically starts with mild memory impairment and progresses to more severe symptoms, including difficulty with language, disorientation, mood swings, and behavioral changes. As the disease advances, individuals may experience significant cognitive decline, requiring assistance with daily activities. Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's, but treatments can help manage symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease in some cases.
    Answer from Reference Model: Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the brain, leading to cognitive decline and memory loss. It is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of cases. The exact cause of Alzheimer's is still not fully understood, but it is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the brain, including beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles. These protein deposits disrupt the communication between brain cells and eventually lead to cell death and the loss of brain tissue. As the disease progresses, individuals with Alzheimer's may experience difficulties with memory, thinking, problem-solving, and eventually lose the ability to perform everyday tasks. Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's, but various treatments and management strategies are available to help alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life.
